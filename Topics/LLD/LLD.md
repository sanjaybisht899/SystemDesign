# LLD 

### _LLD stands for Low-Level Design, which is the process of designing the detailed architecture of a software system at a low level of abstraction. It involves specifying the individual components, their behavior, and interactions with each other, guiding the actual coding of the system._

#
# Prerequisites

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
* Basic data structures and algorithms
* Programming in at least one object-oriented programming language (such as Java, C#, or Python)

# Roadmap

* [Introduction to Low-Level Design:](Intro.md)
    * Overview of LLD, its importance and benefits.
    * Introduction to the SOLID principles and other design patterns.
* [Design Patterns:](Design.md)
    * Overview of various design patterns.
    * Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy patterns.
* [Modular Design:](Modular.md)
    * Designing modular systems.
    * Understanding dependencies.
    * Creating modular architectures.
* [Functional Design:](Functional.md)
    * Functional programming concepts in LLD.
    * Understanding pure functions.
    * Function composition.
* [Advanced Topics:](Advanced.md)
    * Designing for performance and scalability.
    * Refactoring existing code.
    * Common design mistakes and how to avoid them.


# Course Projects

_To apply the concepts learned in the course, students should be given a few projects to work on. The projects should allow students to practice designing and implementing LLD solutions using the concepts learned in the course. Here are a few project ideas:_

- Design and implement a simple web application with a modular architecture.
- Refactor an existing application to adhere to the SOLID principles.
- Implement a concurrent system that handles multiple requests at the same time.
- Design a messaging system that allows for asynchronous communication between components.

_By the end of the course, students should have a good understanding of Low-Level Design concepts, SOLID principles, design patterns, and how to apply them in practice to create maintainable, scalable, and extensible software systems._
